Wealth inequality, global warming and natural resources exploitation are some of the most discussed issues of the last decades. In our project we want to assess the influence that agriculture and livestock farming have on these different topics and how these problems could be solved.
The effect of agriculture will be evaluated by measuring the produced carbon dioxide, the use of pesticides, whether resources are equally distributed on the production chain and eventually how these affect the availability of natural resources. Both the influence of single products and single countries on these matters will be assessed. This will provide us insights on which nations play a key role in this climate change.
